This page describes the schema for the mocks used in 2-point
validation. The format will evolve, that is why it initially looks
contrived: we want to make codes that are capable of working
everything they need from the data itself â€“ this prevents both pain
and possible mistakes from manual intervention. We use HDF5 format. A
useful tool to inspect these is

https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/

The main datasets has the following subdatasets:

## meta

Contains meta information from the run stored as dataset attributes (dataset is otherwise empty).

* colore_key=value are input parameters to CoLoRe run

* version is the current version of the mock

* timestamp contains the time when the mock was created for bookkeeping

## dNdz

mean number density of objects as a function of redshift. Two columns: z and dNdz. The latter is in #/sq deg/dz


## bz

bias of objects as a function of redshift. Two columns: z and bz.


## photoz

Type of photozs used. Information stored as dataset attributes.

The field "type" contains type and at the moment the only valid type is "fixed_sigma".

The actual sigma value is stored in the attribute "sigma" as in sigma(z)/(1+z)="sigma"

In the future, "type" will contain more complicated types.

## window

Window function of the survey. The field "type" contains type and at
the moment the only valid type is "decbcut" (i.e declination and b
cut")

The cuts are stored in "dec_min", "dec_max" and "b_cut" fields. Only
galaxies with declinations between dec_min and dec_max and b>b_cut are
kept.

Parameter b is the galactic longitude and we used icrs->galactic
conversion facility of astropy to determine it.

In the future, this dataset will store more healpix window functions,
etc.  

## objects

Actual positions of objects. The following fields are supported,
although you should not rely on any of them being stored, except "ra"
and "dec" 

* ra - right ascencion in icrs coordinates

* dec - declination in icrs coordinats

* z_real_t - true cosmological redshift in real space

* z_red_t - true cosmological redshift in redshift space

* z_error - realization of the photo-z error if photoz type = fixed_sigma. You should add this to either z_real_t or z_red_t. 
   Note that in version 0.1 due to a idiotic carelessness, numbers were drawn from sigma rather than (1+z)*sigma. 
   You need to multiply this number by (1+z) in order to generate actual error.
